            <summary>
            The allocation record is used to instruct a broker on how to allocate 
            executed shares to sub-accounts.  The allocation record can also be 
            used as a confirmation message through which third parties can communicate 
            execution and settlement instructions between trading partners.
            
            An allocation message can be submitted as new, cancel or replace.  The 
            AllocTransType field indicates the purpose of the message.  When submitting 
            replace or cancel AllocTransType messages the RefAllocID field is required.  
            Replacement allocation messages must contain all data for the replacement 
            allocation.
            
            The allocation record contains repeating fields for each order, sub-account 
            and individual execution; the repeating fields are shown below in typeface 
            Bold-Italic.  The relative position of the repeating fields is important 
            in this record,  i.e. each instance of allocation must be in the order 
            shown below.
            
            *	The total shares allocated must equal the Shares value which must 
            	equal the total executed quantity of the original order.  If present, 
            	the total shares in the execution section must also be equal to 
            	this value.
            *	The number of sub-account instances is indicated in NoAllocs.
            *	Multiple orders can be combined for allocation by identifying the number 
            	of orders in the NoOrders field and each individual order in the OrderID 
            	fields.  Combined orders must have the same ticker, trade date, settlement 
            	date and side.

            The allocation ACK record is used by the broker to acknowledge the receipt 
            and status of an allocation record received from the institution.
            
            It is possible that multiple Allocation ACK messages can be generated 
            for a single allocation to detail the receipt and then the acceptance or 
            rejection of the allocation.

            The Don’t Know Trade (DK) message is used to notify a trading partner 
            that an electronically received execution has been rejected.  This message 
            can be thought of as an execution reject message.
            
            This message has special utility when dealing with one-way execution 
            reporting, if the initial Order Acknowledgment message 
            (LastShares=0 and OrdStatus=New) does not match an existing order this 
            message can be used to notify the broker of a potential problem order.

            <summary>
            The execution report message is used to:
            1.	confirm the receipt of an order 
            2.	confirm changes to an existing order (i.e. accept cancel and replace requests)
            3.	relay order status information
            4.	relay fill information as orders are worked
            5.	reject orders
            6.	report miscellaneous fees calculations associated with a trade
            
            NOTE:	Execution reports do not replace the end-of-day confirm.  Execution reports 
            are to be regarded only as replacements for the existing fill messages currently 
            communicated via telephone.
            
            Each execution message will contain information that will describe the current state 
            of the order and execution status as understood by the broker.   
            
            Execution report messages can be transmitted as transaction types (ExecTransType) 
            NEW, CANCEL, CORRECT or STATUS.  Transaction types CANCEL and CORRECT modify the 
            state of the message identified in field ExecRefID.  Transaction type STATUS 
            indicates that the execution message contains no new information, only summary 
            information regarding order status.
            *	The NEW transaction type indicates that this message represents a new order, 
            	a change in status of the order, or a new fill against an existing order.  The 
            	combination of the ExecTransType and OrdStatus fields will indicate how the 
            	message is to be applied to an order.
            *	The CANCEL transaction type applies at the execution level.  The Cancel 
            	transaction  will be used to cancel an execution which has been reported in 
            	error.  The canceled execution will be identified in the ExecRefID field.
            *	The CORRECT transaction type applies at the execution level and is used to 
            	modify an incorrectly reported fill.  The incorrect execution will be identified 
            	in the ExecRefID field.  Note:  Data reported in the CumQty and AvgPx fields 
            	represent the status of the order as of the time of the correction, not as 
            	of the time of the originally reported execution.
            
            The OrdStatus field is used to identify the status of the current order.  The 
            order statuses are as follows:
            	New - Outstanding order with no executions 
            	Partially Filled - Outstanding order with executions and remaining quantity
            	Filled - Order completely filled, no remaining quantity
            	Done for Day - Order not, or partially, filled;  no further executions forthcoming
            	Canceled - Canceled order with or without executions
            	Replaced - Replaced order with or without executions
            	Pending Cancel/Replace - Order with cancel request pending, used to confirm receipt 
            		of cancel or replace request.  DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THE ORDER HAS BEEN CANCELED OR REPLACED.
            	Stopped - Order has been stopped at the exchange
            	Rejected - Order has been rejected by broker.  NOTE:  An order can be rejected subsequent 
            		to order acknowledgment, i.e. an order can pass from New to Rejected status.
            	Suspended - Order has been placed in suspended state at the request of the client.
            	Pending New - Order has been received by brokers system but not yet accepted for 
            		execution.  An execution message with this status will only be sent in response 
            		to a Status Request message.  
            	Expired - Order has been canceled in broker's system due to time in force instructions.  
            	Calculated - Order has been completed for the day (either filled or done for day).  Miscellaneous 
            		fees have been calculated and reported in this execution message
            
            NOTE:  The canceled and replaced order status is set in response to accepted cancel and 
            	replace requests.  These requests are only acted upon when there is an outstanding 
            	order quantity.  Requests to replace OrderQty to a level less than the CumQty 
            	will be rejected (OrderQty = CumQty + LeavesQty).  Requests to change price on a filled 
            	order will be rejected (see Order Cancel Reject message type).  
            
            The CumQty and AvgPx fields should be calculated to reflect the fills on all versions 
            of an order.  For example, if partially filled order A were replaced by order B, the CumQty 
            and AvgPx on order B's fills should represent the fills on order A plus those on order B. 
            
            The field ClOrdID is provided for institutions to affix an identification number to an 
            order to coincide with internal systems.  The OrderId field is populated with the 
            broker-generated order number.

            Indication of interest messages are used to market merchandise which the broker is 
            buying or selling in either a proprietary or agency capacity.  The indications can 
            be time bound with a specific expiration value.  Indications are distributed with the 
            understanding that other firms may react to the message first and that the merchandise 
            may no longer be available due to prior trade.
            Indication messages can be transmitted in various transaction types; NEW, CANCEL, 
            and REPLACE.  All message types other than NEW modify the state of the message

            The new order list message type is used by institutions wishing to 
            electronically submit lists of related orders to a broker for execution.  
            
            The New Order List is intended for use in staging lists to be executed 
            by the broker.  If the institution wishes to work a list using the broker's 
            execution services the orders should be submitted as individual 
            New Order - Single's.
            
            After staging, the list can be operated on in the following ways:
            Execute:	The broker can be instructed to release the list for execution 
            	by sending the List-Execute message.
            Cancel:	After the list has been staged with the broker, it can be canceled 
            	via the submission of the List Cancel message.  If the list has not yet 
            	been submitted for execution, the List Cancel message will instruct the 
            	broker not to execute it, if the list is being executed, the List Cancel 
            	message should trigger the broker's system to generate cancel requests 
            	for the remaining quantities of each order within the list.  Individual 
            	orders within the list can be canceled via the Order Cancel Request message.
            Status:	A status of the list can be requested via the submission of the 
            	List-Status Request message.  The broker will respond with one or more 
            	List-Status messages which will report executed quantity, canceled quantity 
            	and average price for each order in the list.
            Replace:	Individual orders within the list can be replaced via 
            	Order Cancel/Replace Request messages. 
            
            Executions against orders within the list will not normally be reported as they 
            occur.  (If this feature is desired the institution and broker should arrange 
            for this reporting as a custom feature using the Execution message.)  Executions 
            against the list will be reported within the List-Status message.

            Orders can be submitted with special handling instructions and execution

            explicit directions as to how the order should be executed (see ExecInst field).
            
            New Order messages received with the PossResend flag set in the header should 
            be validated by ClOrdID and order  parameters (side, symbol, quantity, etc.) to 
            determine if the order had been previously submitted.  PossResends previously 
            received should be acknowledged back to the client via an Execution - Status 
            message.  PossResends not previously received should be processed as a new 
            order and acknowledged via an Execution - New message.

            only when an outstanding quantity exists; orders which are filled

            the ClOrdId of the replacement order is inserted in the ClOrdId field of 
            the Cancel Reject message for identification.
            
            Only a limited number of fields can be changed via the cancel/replace 
            request message.  All other fields should be retransmitted as sent in the

            The order cancel request message is used to request the cancellation

            CxlType field is used to distinguish if all or part of the outstanding

            The request will only be accepted if the order can successfully be 
            pulled back from the exchange floor without executing.
            
            Note that a cancel request is assigned an order id and is treated as 
            a separate entity.  If rejected, the order id of the cancel request 
            will be sent in the Cancel Reject message.  The OrderID assigned to the 
            cancel request must be unique amongst the OrderID’s assigned to regular 
            orders and replacement orders.

            The quote message is used as the response to a quote request message and 
            can be used to publish unsolicited quotes.
            
            Quotes supplied as the result of a Quote Request message are tagged with the 
            appropriate QuoteReqID, unsolicited quotes can be identified by the absence 
            of a  QuoteReqID.
            
            The symbol used for forex quotes is, in ISO codes, “currency1.currency2” (e.g. GBP.USD) 
            and the quote will be returned as a rate expressed as currency1/currency2.  BidPx 
            indicates the rate at which the broker is willing to buy currency1 and deliver 
            currency2, OfferPx indicates the rate at which the broker is willing to sell currency1 
            and receive currency2.  Indicative rates are quoted in the BidPx field and may contain 
            a level in the BidSize field.
            
            Orders can be generated based on Quotes, quoted orders include the QuoteID and 
            are OrdType=Quoted Order.

            <summary>
            In some markets it is the practice to request quotes from brokers prior to 
            placement of an order.  The quote request message is used for this purpose.
            
            Quotes can be requested on specific securities or for forex rates.
            
            Securities quotes can be requested as either market quotes or for a specific 
            quantity and side.  If OrderQty and Side are absent, a market-style 
            quote (bid x offer, size x size) will be returned.
            
            The symbol used for forex quotes is, in ISO codes, “currency1.currency2” (e.g. GBP.USD) 
            and the quote will be returned as a rate expressed as currency1/currency2.
            
            Forex quotes can be requested as indicative or at a specific quantity level.  If an 
            indicative quote is requested (OrderQty and Side are absent), the broker has 
            discretion to quote at either a specific trade level and side or to provide an 
            indicative quote at the mid-point of the spread.  The broker can also choose to 
            respond to an indicative quote by sending multiple quote messages specifying 
            various levels and sides.
