            Scheduler performs session connection maintenance according 
            to the specified schedule for session activities. It monitors 
            whenever criteria to log a particular session either on or off 
            is triggered and automatically executes appropriate action.
            <remarks>
            Scheduler implements IDisposable interface to provide users
            with the ability to shutdown scheduling services by single 
            action. Supporting IDisposable interface also gives the 
            opportunity to combine Scheduler with built-in language 
            statements like using statement in C# and make scheduling 
            more error-resistant.

            Scheduler doesn't notify about all errors occurred

            connection was dropped, scheduler will not fire error 
            event immediately. Instead, it will perform reconnection 
            attempts according to FIX Engine settings. Only if all 
            attempts will fail, scheduler will fire error event.
